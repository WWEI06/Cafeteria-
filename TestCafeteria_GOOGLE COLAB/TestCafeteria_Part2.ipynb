              "' Unterscheidung between data lakehouse and data warehouse is a common topic of discussion in the data engineering community, as both are designed to store large amounts of data but have different architectures, use cases, and benefits. A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all the data from various sources in its raw form, without transforming or processing it. On the other hand, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically after cleaning, transforming, and organizing it.\\n\\nHere are some key differences between a data lakehouse and a data warehouse:\\n\\n1. Data Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its raw form, including semi-structured and unstructured data, while a data warehouse stores data in a structured format, typically in a relational database management system (RDBMS).\\n2. Data Processing: A data lakehouse does not process or transform data, whereas a data warehouse often performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes on the data to make it fit for analysis.\\n3. Scalability: A data lakehouse can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster, while a data warehouse can scale vertically by increasing the power of the hardware.\\n4. Cost: A data lakehouse can be less expensive than a data warehouse due to its distributed architecture and lack of need for complex data processing.\\n5. Use Cases: A data lakehouse is suitable for use cases that require handling large volumes of diverse data, such as IoT sensor data, social media analytics, or financial transactions. A data warehouse is better suited for use cases that require fast query performance, such as sales forecasting or customer segmentation.\\n6. Query Performance: A data lakehouse can provide faster query performance than a data warehouse due to its distributed architecture and ability to parallelize queries across multiple nodes.\\n7. Data Governance: A data lakehouse provides more flexibility in terms of data governance, allowing for more flexible data access and sharing across different teams and departments.\\n8. Data Security: Both data lakehouses and data warehouses provide robust security features to protect sensitive data, but data lakehouses may offer more advanced security features due to their distributed architecture.\\n9. Integration: A data lakehouse can integrate with various data sources, including'"
